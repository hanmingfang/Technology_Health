This branch has the version with CARA preferences and Type I extreme value shocks on the profit functions.
The functions to compute the deterministic version (with the thresholds) are included just for comparison purposes.
The corresponding document is in the repository folder "branch_document" and it is updated until page 14 (the document includes skill types but the code doesn't include it).
